            The U|Grow project started as a senior capstone project
            within the Lehigh University Global Citizenship Program,
            which seeks to create young adults who strive for personal,
            social, and corporate responsibility within the global community.
            The U|Grow team began with an interest in improving the Lehigh campus climate surrounding gender.
            The team quickly grew this vision to connect and include communities from all over the world.

        <p>
            The project is designed to aid individuals both on Lehigh’s campus and across the globe
            in understanding, developing, and sharing their gender identity in a way which fosters equity
            and inclusion in their communities. It is structured to promote both individual reflection and greater
            understanding through interaction with others. The user reflects upon their own
            identity and experiences and then has the ability to explore others’ identities and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of the U|Grow initiative is to create more inclusive and equitable communities
            through increased awareness of the role gender plays in our lives.  We hope that each of our
            users is able to use U|Grow to better understand both their own gendered experiences and those of others.
